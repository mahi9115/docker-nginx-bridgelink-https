### Port Configuration
| Repository | HTTP | HTTPS | Direct Access |
|------------|------|-------|---------------|
| Original | 80 | ❌ | 8443 |
| HTTPS-Enhanced | 80 (redirects) | 443 ✅ | 8443 |

### Use Cases

**Original Repository:**
- Quick HTTP-only deployments
- Simple development environments
- Internal networks without SSL requirements

**HTTPS-Enhanced Repository:**
- Production deployments with SSL/TLS
- Development with SSL testing
- Security-focused environments
- Public-facing APIs requiring encryption

### Migration Path

To migrate from original to HTTPS-enhanced:
```bash
# Clone the HTTPS-enhanced version
git clone https://github.com/mahi9115/docker-nginx-bridgelink-https.git
cd docker-nginx-bridgelink-https

# For development SSL
make ssl-dev

# For production SSL
make ssl-prod DOMAIN=yourdomain.com EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
```

### Recommendation
- Use **HTTPS-Enhanced Repository** for all new deployments
- Original repository remains for backward compatibility and simple HTTP deployments
